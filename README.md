# CV
My CV, in [jsonresume](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema) format.
Obeys the schema as last updated on
[April 27th, 2016](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/blob/81458745bf48981ea5f9beb124d2f1378ef56ff1/schema.json).

At some point, I'll migrate away from my
[current resume](http://thekev.in/resource/cv.pdf) to this one -- I love the
idea of a CV-as-code, but the schema is still missing some features I'd like.

This repository continuously deploys several versions of my CV:
- [Crisp style](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/TheKevJames/cv/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/resume-crisp.html?branch=master&filter=successful)
- [Flat style](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/TheKevJames/cv/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/resume-flat.html?branch=master&filter=successful)
- [Modern style](https://circleci.com/api/v1/project/TheKevJames/cv/latest/artifacts/0/$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS/resume-modern.html?branch=master&filter=successful)
